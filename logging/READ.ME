Logging in classes on Logging :D 

Rust is very careful on what it adds to the standard library. We'll try this out on the puzzle_game project. 

Logging has 5 layers:
    1. error!;
    2. warn!
    3. info!
    4. debug! 
    5. trace! <- this layer includes all of the above! 

We can signal which level we want the call stack to refer to.
